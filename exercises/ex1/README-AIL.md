## Exercise 1.2 Familiarize yourself with the AI Launchpad UI

After completing these steps you will have a basic understanding of AI Launchpad's Generative AI Hub components and how they interact.

For this hands-on session we will mainly work with the Generative AI Hub in AI Launchpad focusing mainly on three capabilities of SAP AI Launchpad: Prompt Management, evaluations, and optimizations. However, these capabilities interact with other components of AI Launchpad and SAP AI Core. So let's get familiar with the Generative AI Hub.

You already see the `Prompt Editor` interface after logging in. It is designed to create prompts, and experiment with prompts and models. 

1.	Click on `Generative AI Hub`
